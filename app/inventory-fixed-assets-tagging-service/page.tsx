            Identification of lost or broken assets for immediate write-off
          </p>
          <p>
            Lost assets pose risks to an organisation including but not limited
            to: inaccurate balance sheets, lost productivity, higher operating
            expenses from overpayment of taxes, insurance and service contracts,
            inaccurate asset capital expenditure budgeting. Broken assets may be
            unecessarily covered by service contracts.

          <p className="font-bold">Identification of unregistered assets</p>
          <p>
            Unregistered assets can cause a company to be undervalued and lead
            to inaccurate balance sheets. Maintenance operations may exclude
            unregistered assets, which leads to lack of maintenance and
            inspection history on these assets and affects risk assessment.
            Unregistered assets may also not be covered by insurance. From a
            financial perspective, inaccuracy in asset database affects capital
            allowance claims, insurance charges and profit figure reporting.
